# Classifying Fake News Using Onion Data

The spread of misinformation threatens businesses and their reputations worldwide.  A 2019 report from the University of Baltimore estimates that companies spend over $9.5B to combat the negative impact of misinformation on their brands annually. To limit the spread of misinformation and mitigate its negative impact, companies need to find and debunk fake news as quickly as possible. 

To explore the ability of data and analytics to address this issue, my teammates Laura Catano, Laura Cattaneo, [Casey Easterday](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caeasterday/), Callie Page, and I collected titles from subreddit r/TheOnion and r/nottheonion, and built a classifier to try to classify if an article is "fake" based on only title. In th notebook, we tried several text analysis techniques including Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF, as well as different machine learning model such as Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes. In addition, we also tested our classifier on external Kaggle dataset.
